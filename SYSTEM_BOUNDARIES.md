# Pressure X — System Boundaries and Scope Definition

## Purpose
This document defines the explicit system boundaries of the Pressure X concept.  
Its purpose is to prevent misinterpretation, overextension of claims, or incorrect classification during technical review.

Pressure X is intentionally narrow in scope.

---

## 1. System Classification

Pressure X is classified as:
- A **passive structural mitigation layer**
- A **secondary load-shaping component**
- A **non-primary structural element**

It is intended to be integrated within larger, validated aerospace structures.

---

## 2. Included Capabilities

Pressure X is intended to provide:
- Reduction of peak transmitted accelerations
- Broadening of impulsive load duration
- Partial dissipation of mechanical energy
- Supplemental vibration attenuation

All behavior is:
- Passive
- Deterministic
- Material- and geometry-driven

---

## 3. Explicit Exclusions (Non-Capabilities)

Pressure X does **not**:
- Serve as a primary load-bearing structure
- Replace pressure vessels or hull skins
- Prevent MMOD penetration
- Provide active vibration control
- Generate, store, or route energy
- Adapt dynamically to changing environments
- Self-heal or autonomously reconfigure

---

## 4. Materials and Physics Boundaries

Pressure X:
- Relies on conventional, physically plausible materials
- Makes no claims of exotic physics
- Does not require metamaterials, negative stiffness, or non-linear control systems
- Does not invoke proprietary or undisclosed material behavior

Any material-specific implementation remains subject to validation.

---

## 5. Integration Boundaries

Pressure X is intended to:
- Be layered within existing structural architectures
- Interface through standard bonding or mechanical attachment methods
- Be removable or replaceable if required

It is not intended to:
- Alter vehicle-level architecture
- Require redesign of primary load paths
- Introduce mission-critical single points of failure

---

## 6. Regulatory and Programmatic Boundaries

Pressure X:
- Is conceived for civilian and commercial aerospace use
- Makes no military performance claims
- Is not positioned as controlled technical data

Programmatic integration remains subject to customer-specific regulatory review.

---

## 7. Status
This document defines **intentional constraints**, not limitations imposed by lack of development.  
Pressure X is deliberately scoped to remain testable, integrable, and evaluable.
