### Technical Risks

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| PCB design errors causing failures | Medium     | High   | Conduct thorough simulation and peer reviews; iterate prototypes |
| Mechanical housing fit issues      | Low        | Medium | Use precise 3D modeling and tolerance analysis           |
| Sensor inaccuracies in space       | Medium     | High   | Calibrate extensively on Earth; plan for in-situ calibration if possible |
| Communication failure              | Low        | High   | Select robust aerospace-grade connectors and shielding   |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Delays in prototype fabrication    | Medium     | Medium | Identify multiple suppliers; maintain buffer in timeline |
| Testing schedule overruns           | Low        | High   | Early test planning; pre-validate test setups            |

### Financial Risks

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Budget constraints for prototype   | High       | High   | Prioritize critical components; seek external funding or partnerships |

### Environmental Risks

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Exposure to unexpected space conditions | Low   | High   | Follow rigorous space qualification standards; perform extensive simulation and ground testing |
