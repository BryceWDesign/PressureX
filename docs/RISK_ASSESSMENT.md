# PressureX Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

## Overview
This document identifies risks during development and outlines mitigation strategies.

---

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| PCB design errors causing failures | Medium | High | Peer review; prototype iterations; post-assembly inspection and test |
| Mechanical housing fit issues | Low | Medium | Tolerance analysis; physical fit checks with representative hardware |
| Sensor inaccuracies under stress | Medium | High | Baseline characterization; controlled environment testing; calibration strategy |
| Communication failure | Low | High | Use locking connectors where needed; verify strain relief; EMI considerations |

---

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Delays in prototype fabrication | Medium | Medium | Multiple suppliers; buffer time in plan |
| Testing schedule overruns | Low | High | Pre-validate test setups; run small pilots first |

---

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Budget constraints for prototypes | High | High | Prioritize high-signal tests; reduce scope to falsification-first |

---

### Environmental Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Unexpected environmental stressors | Low | High | Define environment clearly; test to the defined environment; document margins and failure modes |

## Conclusion
Risk monitoring and proactive mitigation are required to prevent overstating readiness. This repo is structured for review; performance claims require traceable test data.
