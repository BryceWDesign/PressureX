# Risk Assessment for PressureX Sensor Project

## 1. Technical Risks

| Risk                            | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                       |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Sensor component failure       | Medium     | High   | Use proven components; extensive testing  |
| PCB design errors              | Medium     | Medium | Peer review; simulation and prototype tests|
| Mechanical housing failure    | Low        | High   | Use aerospace-grade materials; FEA analysis|
| Communication interface issues | Medium     | High   | Use space-qualified connectors; test protocols|
| Environmental test failures   | Medium     | High   | Early-stage environmental simulations and tests|

## 2. Programmatic Risks

| Risk                              | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                        |
|----------------------------------|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| Budget constraints                | High       | High   | Seek partnerships; open-source collaboration|
| Delays in component procurement  | Medium     | Medium | Early ordering; multiple suppliers          |
| Limited access to test facilities| Medium     | High   | Leverage partnerships; use simulation tools |

## 3. External Risks

| Risk                               | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                          |
|-----------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Regulatory approval delays         | Low        | Medium | Early engagement with regulatory bodies      |
| Changes in mission requirements    | Medium     | High   | Maintain design flexibility and modularity   |
| Lack of stakeholder interest       | Medium     | High   | Active outreach; demonstrate value proposition|
