## Technical Risks

### 1. Sensor Accuracy Degradation
- **Risk:** Sensor readings drift due to harsh environmental conditions (temperature, radiation).
- **Mitigation:** Use radiation-hardened components; conduct extensive calibration; design redundancy in sensor array.

### 2. Mechanical Failure
- **Risk:** Structural failure due to vibration, shock, or thermal expansion.
- **Mitigation:** Use aerospace-grade materials; incorporate vibration damping; conduct environmental testing.

### 3. Communication Failure
- **Risk:** Loss or corruption of sensor data transmission.
- **Mitigation:** Implement error-checking protocols; shield communication lines; use redundant communication paths.

## Project Risks

### 1. Funding Limitations
- **Risk:** Inability to finance prototyping and testing.
- **Mitigation:** Seek partnerships with academic institutions, government grants, or industry sponsors.

### 2. Testing Constraints
- **Risk:** Limited access to space-grade test facilities.
- **Mitigation:** Use simulation tools extensively; collaborate with third-party testing labs.

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
- **Risk:** Failure to meet aerospace safety and quality standards.
- **Mitigation:** Early consultation with standards documents; engage aerospace engineering consultants as needed.

## Operational Risks

### 1. Deployment Challenges
- **Risk:** Difficulty integrating sensor system with existing spacecraft systems.
- **Mitigation:** Design modular and flexible interfaces; ensure thorough documentation.

### 2. Maintenance and Repair
- **Risk:** Limited ability to repair or replace sensors once deployed.
- **Mitigation:** Design for high reliability; include self-diagnostics.
