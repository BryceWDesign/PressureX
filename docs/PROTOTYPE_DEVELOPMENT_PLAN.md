# Prototype Development Plan for PressureX

## Objective
Outline a structured approach to developing a functional prototype of the PressureX sensor system, balancing technical feasibility, cost, and timeline.

---

## Phase 1: Design Finalization and Simulation

- Complete detailed electrical schematics and PCB layout.
- Perform circuit simulations (SPICE or KiCad) to verify electrical behavior.
- Conduct mechanical fit and clearance checks using CAD models.

**Deliverables:**  
- Verified PCB design files  
- Simulation reports  
- CAD assembly model

**Timeline:** 1-2 months

---

## Phase 2: Fabrication and Assembly

- Procure PCB fabrication and component sourcing.
- Assemble first prototype units in-house or through a contract manufacturer.
- Build mechanical housing with rapid prototyping methods (3D printing or CNC machining).

**Deliverables:**  
- Fully assembled prototype units  
- Mechanical housings

**Timeline:** 2-3 months

---

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- Perform bench testing for sensor accuracy, response time, and durability.
- Conduct environmental stress tests including thermal cycling and vibration.
- Collect and analyze data for design iteration.

**Deliverables:**  
- Test protocols and results documentation  
- Updated design recommendations

**Timeline:** 1-2 months

---

## Phase 4: Iteration and Optimization

- Refine electrical and mechanical designs based on test feedback.
- Implement improvements in PCB and housing.
- Prepare final prototype for demonstration or field testing.

**Deliverables:**  
- Revised design files  
- Final prototype ready for deployment

**Timeline:** 2 months

---

## Notes

- Early engagement with testing partners or labs is advised to align protocols with aerospace standards.
- Parallel development of firmware and data acquisition software is recommended for integration readiness.
