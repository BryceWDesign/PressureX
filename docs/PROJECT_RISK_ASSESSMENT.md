# Project Risk Assessment

This document outlines potential risks associated with PressureX and proposed mitigation strategies.

## 1. Technical Risks

### a. Sensor Accuracy and Reliability
- **Risk:** Sensor readings may drift or degrade over time due to temperature cycling, vibration, or other environmental stressors.
- **Mitigation:** Select components appropriate to the intended environment; incorporate calibration routines; design for serviceability and repeatable test conditions.

### b. Hardware Integration Challenges
- **Risk:** Mechanical mounting and electrical connections may fail due to vibration and shock.
- **Mitigation:** Robust mounting design; validated strain relief; prototype vibration/shock testing with documented fixtures and torque.

### c. Signal Integrity Issues
- **Risk:** Electrical noise and interference could corrupt data.
- **Mitigation:** Shielding/filtering as required; careful grounding; verify with EMI/ESD tests where relevant.

## 2. Operational Risks

### a. Testing Constraints
- **Risk:** Limited access to high-end environmental test facilities.
- **Mitigation:** Use a staged validation plan; start with bench tests; partner with labs/facilities when needed.

### b. Resource Limitations
- **Risk:** Budget constraints may limit prototyping iterations.
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize the highest signal-to-cost tests; focus on falsification tests early.

## 3. Regulatory and Compliance
- **Risk:** Misalignment with program standards if pursued for flight use.
- **Mitigation:** Treat all protocols as templates; tailor to program requirements; document traceable test evidence before any compliance statements.
