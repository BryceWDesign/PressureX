# Project Risk Assessment

This document outlines potential risks associated with the PressureX project and proposed mitigation strategies to ensure successful development and deployment.

## 1. Technical Risks

### a. Sensor Accuracy and Reliability
- **Risk:** Sensor readings may drift or degrade over time due to harsh space environment (radiation, thermal cycling).
- **Mitigation:** Use radiation-hardened sensor components; incorporate calibration routines and redundancy in sensor arrays.

### b. Hardware Integration Challenges
- **Risk:** Mechanical mounting and electrical connections may fail due to vibration and shock during launch.
- **Mitigation:** Design robust mounting hardware using aerospace-grade materials; perform vibration and shock testing simulations.

### c. Signal Integrity Issues
- **Risk:** Electrical noise and interference could corrupt sensor data.
- **Mitigation:** Employ shielded cables (e.g., twisted pair or ribbon cable with shielding); use differential signaling and filtering.

## 2. Operational Risks

### a. Testing Constraints
- **Risk:** Inability to perform full-scale physical testing in space environment.
- **Mitigation:** Utilize simulation tools extensively; collaborate with aerospace partners for ground testing facilities.

### b. Resource Limitations
- **Risk:** Budget constraints may limit prototyping and iterative development.
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical components; pursue funding and partnerships with aerospace organizations.

## 3. Project Management Risks

### a. Timeline Delays
- **Risk:** Delays in component sourcing or development milestones.
- **Mitigation:** Build buffer periods into schedule; maintain supplier communication.

### b. Regulatory and Compliance
- **Risk:** Project may not meet aerospace standards.
- **Mitigation:** Consult aerospace regulations early; design to MIL-STD and NASA/SpaceX recommended standards.
