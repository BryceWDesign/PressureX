# Simulation Results: Shear-Thickening Behavior

This document describes the results produced by the `stararmor_simulation.py` script found in `/src`.

## Purpose

The simulation models the behavior of a conceptual shear-thickening fluid (STF) material layer that stiffens under increasing pressure. This simulates a potential passive protection layer for spacecraft hulls under high-stress conditions.

## Output

The simulation produces a 2D plot showing:

- **X-axis**: Applied Pressure (arbitrary units)
- **Y-axis**: Material Stiffness (arbitrary units)

As pressure increases, the STF behavior rapidly transitions from soft to rigid — mimicking real-world STF dynamics. This demonstrates that the material becomes a force-distribution layer under stress.

## Relevance

This stiffening effect provides:

- Distributed stress shielding
- Dynamic resistance scaling with pressure
- Passive reinforcement with no moving parts

These characteristics make STFs promising for:

- Launch and re-entry protection
- Internal buffer zones between fuselage layers
- Reinforcement around high-strain nodes (e.g., engine mounts)

## Next Phase

Further steps include:

- Calibration against real STF data
- Dynamic simulation during motion events (vibration, G-loading)
- Prototyping membrane-encapsulated STF panels for real-world testing
