# PressureX Structural Integration Overview

## 1. System Architecture

PressureX is designed as a **structural sandwich layer** for spacecraft skins, made possible by the unique properties of shear-thickening fluids (STFs). It consists of:

- **Outer Hull Layer (Rigid Skin)**: The primary spacecraft skin (e.g., stainless steel or composite)
- **STF Membrane Layer**: Thin, sealed, shear-thickening fluid layer that hardens under pressure
- **Inner Conformal Membrane**: Durable, flexible substrate that conforms to internal geometry
