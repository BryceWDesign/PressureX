# PressureX Simulation and Validation Plan

## Objective  
To validate the PressureX system in the absence of in-space deployment, a comprehensive suite of virtual tests and simulations will be employed using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Electrical Simulation Strategy

### Tools
- KiCad’s Eeschema + Ngspice integration
- LTspice (for analog sub-circuit validation)

### Goals
- Validate power distribution and load response
- Analyze signal integrity and crosstalk
- Model sensor signal output under expected pressure ranges

### Methods
- Simulate voltage and current across nodes
- Perform transient analysis for dynamic loads
- Use equivalent sensor models for response validation

## Mechanical Stress & Thermal Modeling

### Tools
- Fusion 360 Simulation Environment
- ANSYS Mechanical (optional, advanced)

### Goals
- Analyze structural rigidity under vibration
- Test thermal expansion and stress distribution
- Simulate mounting point stress tolerance

### Methods
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on 3D model
- Apply G-loads and vibration profiles
- Simulate -100°C to +125°C temperature cycles

## Environmental Scenario Modeling

### Tools
- COMSOL Multiphysics (or open source alternatives like Elmer FEM)

### Goals
- Simulate vacuum exposure, thermal dissipation
- Radiation impact on electronic components

### Methods
- Heat transfer simulations
- EM shielding efficacy
- Evaluate performance of internal pressure isolation layer

## Validation Criteria

| Module            | Method                     | Pass Criteria                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| PCB Power Circuit | Electrical simulation      | All voltages/currents within tolerance |
| Sensor Accuracy   | SPICE and analog modeling  | Output within ±2% of expected range    |
| Housing Integrity | Structural + thermal FEA   | No critical stress failures            |
| EMI Resistance    | Shielding simulation       | Signal degradation < 5%                |

## Conclusion

Virtual validation will be critical to de-risk the PressureX concept. This plan ensures pressure sensor performance, system reliability, and survivability before hardware is fabricated.
