# PressureX: Reality Check and Feasibility Considerations

## Introduction

This document is meant to present an honest and transparent assessment of the PressureX concept's development limitations and the reality of taking it beyond the theoretical design stage without access to space-based testing infrastructure or significant capital.

---

## 1. Developer Background

- **Developer Name:** Bryce (not an aerospace engineer)
- **Primary Skillset:** UX/UI Design, reverse engineering, and systems-level conceptual thinking
- **Approach:** Design methodology driven by critical analysis, logical deduction, and emulation of existing aerospace-grade problem-solving processes.

---

## 2. Current Development Status

- All documentation, system architecture, and engineering design artifacts are available in this GitHub repository.
- Simulations are proposed but untested due to lack of hardware and tools.
- Physical prototyping, vacuum testing, and launch-grade qualification are not currently feasible for me at this time due to personal cost limitations.

## 3. Known Limitations

| Limitation                                | Current Mitigation Plan                  |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No funding for material procurement        | Open-source transparency to attract backers |
| No access to space testing                 | Leverage simulation, seek academic collaboration |
| No direct aerospace affiliation            | Appeal to merit of the concept and originality |
| No custom sensor inventory                 | Use existing sensor emulation models     |

## 4. What Makes PressureX Worth Watching?

- Offers a non-invasive, low-cost solution to a known high-cost problem.
- Entirely based on modular, swappable components.
- Designed to scale with launch vehicle evolution (Starship, Falcon 9, etc.)
- Could integrate into existing sensor arrays without mission-critical interference.

## 5. Invitation to Stakeholders

To any organization capable of furthering this design with facilities, funding, or aerospace-grade testing environments:
> Your involvement could turn this concept into a launch-ready technology.

All blueprints, logic, rationale, and documentation have been provided. Serious inquiries and technical collaboration are welcome.

## 6. Closing Thoughts

This is not a blueprint from a NASA lab. It's an effort from a non-traditional mind applying engineering logic to a known problemâ€”without the privilege of an aerospace budget or title.

What it lacks in certification, it makes up for in raw innovation, modularity, and simplicity.
