# Hardware Setup and Integration for PressureX

## Overview

PressureX interfaces with pressure sensors and related hardware components for data acquisition and analysis. This guide explains the hardware required and how to set it up.

## Components

- Pressure Sensor Model XYZ123 (Supplier: ExampleSupplier)
- Microcontroller: ESP32 Dev Kit (or equivalent)
- Connecting cables and power supply
- Breadboard or custom PCB for wiring

## Wiring Diagram

- Sensor VCC → Microcontroller 3.3V or 5V (as specified)
- Sensor GND → Microcontroller GND
- Sensor Output → Microcontroller ADC pin (e.g., GPIO36)

## Hardware Requirements

- Ensure stable power supply to avoid noisy sensor readings.
- Use shielded cables if operating in noisy environments.
- Calibrate sensors as per manufacturer guidelines before use.

## Assembly Instructions

1. Connect components as per the wiring diagram (`schematic.svg`).
2. Double-check all connections for firm contact.
3. Power up the microcontroller and verify sensor data transmission.
4. Connect the microcontroller to your PC via USB for firmware upload and serial monitoring.

## Testing

- Use a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, minicom) to monitor sensor output.
- Confirm sensor readings change when pressure is applied or released.
