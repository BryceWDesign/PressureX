# Internal Notes (Non-technical)

This folder contains planning notes that are **not part of the engineering evaluation package**.  
They are kept for completeness but are intentionally separated so technical reviewers land first on the core documents (boundaries, targets, failure modes, validation).

Nothing in this folder implies funding requests, program engagement, or external endorsement.
