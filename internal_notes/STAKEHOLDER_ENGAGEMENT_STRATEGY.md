# Stakeholder / Outreach Notes (Internal)

## Purpose
Internal note to outline how to route the PressureX evaluation package to the right technical reviewers.

This document is **not** part of the technical evidence and does not imply endorsement or existing relationships.

## Target reviewer roles (ideal)
- Structures / loads / dynamics engineers
- Environmental test engineers (vibration/shock/thermal)
- Materials engineers (containment, stability, aging)
- Systems engineers (integration constraints, failure modes)

## Engagement channels (low-noise)
- Share the repo link with a short “prove/kill” framing
- Request a single falsification test suggestion + pass/fail metric
- Move deep review to DM/email to avoid comment-thread noise

## Messaging guardrails
- State design-intent targets as hypotheses (not results)
- No compliance/qualification claims without traceable test data
- Keep scope tight: what it is / what it is not
