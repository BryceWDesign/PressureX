# Funding and Resource Notes (Internal)

## Purpose
These notes exist to capture possible resourcing paths if PressureX were ever pursued beyond concept evaluation. They are **not a funding solicitation** and are not required to review the engineering package.

## Current stance
The intent of this repository is to enable:
- Technical review (prove/kill quickly)
- Consulting discussions around validation planning, boundaries, and failure thinking

## If resources were needed (generic options)
- Partner with labs (university or commercial) for environment testing
- Pursue paid consulting engagements focused on validation planning
- If appropriate in the future, explore standard innovation programs or grants (program-specific)

## Note
Any future resourcing plan should follow after technical triage and a clearly defined validation milestone plan.
