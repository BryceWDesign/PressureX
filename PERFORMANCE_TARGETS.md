# Pressure X — Performance Targets

## Purpose
This document defines the preliminary, non-binding performance targets for the Pressure X structural mitigation concept.  
All values are **design-intent targets**, not claims of achieved performance. They are intended to guide analysis, simulation, and early-stage validation.

Pressure X is conceived as a **passive, mass-minimal structural layer** intended to reduce impulsive loads, vibration transmission, and localized impact damage in orbital-class vehicles and aerospace structures.

---

## 1. Design Scope

Pressure X is intended to operate within the following scope:

- Passive structural behavior only (no active control, no sensors required)
- Operates under impulsive, transient, and vibrational loading
- Integrated as a sub-layer within existing hull or panel architectures
- Applicable to spacecraft, launch vehicles, and high-vibration industrial platforms

---

## 2. Target Load Environments

### 2.1 Impact Environment (Non-Penetrating Events)
- Micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD), non-catastrophic regime
- Relative impact velocities (design consideration):  
  **1–7 km/s (contextual reference, not a tested limit)**
- Intended behavior: load spreading, impulse broadening, and peak stress reduction  
  *not* primary debris capture or penetration arrest

### 2.2 Vibrational Environment
- Launch acoustic excitation
- Engine-induced structural vibration
- Stage separation shock coupling
- Broadband vibration transmission through hull structures

---

## 3. Performance Targets (Preliminary)

### 3.1 Peak Acceleration Attenuation
- Target reduction of transmitted peak g-loads:  
  **20–40%** relative to baseline rigid or monolithic structures of equivalent mass

### 3.2 Impulse Broadening
- Target increase in impulse duration:  
  **1.5× – 3×** relative to baseline  
- Objective: reduce peak stress by distributing energy over time

### 3.3 Energy Dissipation Efficiency
- Target energy dissipation per unit mass:  
  **≥15–30 J/g** (order-of-magnitude target)
- Mechanism: internal friction, phase lag, structural hysteresis

### 3.4 Mass Penalty
- Target mass fraction:  
  **≤5–8%** of host panel or hull mass
- Pressure X must remain competitive with existing passive mitigation solutions

---

## 4. Comparative Intent (Non-Exhaustive)

Pressure X performance targets are set to be competitive with or complementary to:

- Honeycomb and isogrid cores
- Viscoelastic damping layers
- Shear-thickening composite inserts
- Tuned mass or constrained-layer damping approaches

Pressure X is **not intended to replace** Whipple shields or primary MMOD barriers.

---

## 5. Operating Limits (Assumed)

These limits represent conservative assumptions pending validation:

- Operating temperature range: **–150 °C to +120 °C**
- No reliance on cryogenic phase change
- No requirement for active thermal management
- Performance degradation expected under extreme thermal cycling (to be quantified)

---

## 6. Non-Goals (Explicit)

Pressure X does **not** claim to:
- Prevent hull penetration from high-energy MMOD events
- Eliminate structural vibration entirely
- Function as a load-bearing primary structure
- Provide propulsion, power generation, or active control

---

## 7. Status
This document defines **initial engineering targets only**.  
All values are subject to refinement, validation, or rejection through simulation and test.
