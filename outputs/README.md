# Directory: outputs/

This folder will contain any auto-generated outputs from simulation runs, such as visual plots, logs, or result datasets.

Currently expected files:
- `stf_response_plot.png`: A PNG chart showing the STF viscosity curve under pressure.

Ensure this folder exists before running any simulations. If it does not exist, the script may fail when trying to save outputs.

No manual editing required here â€” this folder is for generated content only.
