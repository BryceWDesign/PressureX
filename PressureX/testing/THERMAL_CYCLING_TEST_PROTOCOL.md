# Thermal Cycling Test Protocol for PressureX Hardware

## Purpose

To assess the reliability and performance of the PressureX sensor assembly and PCB when subjected to temperature extremes and cycling typical of space environments.

---

## Test Setup

- **Test Item:** Fully assembled PressureX sensor PCB with enclosure  
- **Thermal Chamber:** Capable of cycling from -40°C to +85°C  
- **Monitoring:** Temperature sensors attached to critical components; continuous functional monitoring recommended

## Test Conditions

| Cycle Count | Temperature Range | Dwell Time (min) | Ramp Rate (°C/min) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 100         | -40°C to +85°C    | 30               | 10                 |

## Test Procedure

1. Place test item in thermal chamber and connect monitoring equipment.  
2. Start thermal cycling according to the parameters above.  
3. Monitor the functional output of the sensor during dwell times if possible.  
4. Perform visual inspections at designated cycle intervals (e.g., every 20 cycles).  
5. Upon completion, allow test item to stabilize at room temperature before final functional test.  
6. Document any anomalies, physical changes, or performance degradation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- No visible mechanical damage or deformation.  
- Sensor output remains within specified tolerance range throughout and after cycling.  
- No intermittent failures or signal dropouts observed.

## Reporting

Log all temperature profiles, inspection notes, and sensor performance data in the Test Results Log.
