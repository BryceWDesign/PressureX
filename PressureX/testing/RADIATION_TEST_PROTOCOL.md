# Radiation Test Protocol for PressureX Hardware

## Purpose

To evaluate the effects of ionizing radiation on the PressureX sensor electronics and PCB, ensuring continued operation in space radiation environments.

---

## Test Setup

- **Test Item:** Fully assembled PressureX sensor PCB  
- **Radiation Source:** Cobalt-60 gamma source or equivalent  
- **Dosimetry:** Calibrated dosimeters placed near the test item for dose measurement  
- **Monitoring:** Continuous functional monitoring recommended if equipment allows

## Test Conditions

| Radiation Type | Total Dose        | Dose Rate      | Test Duration |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Gamma (Co-60)  | 30 krad(Si) total | 5 krad(Si)/hr  | 6 hours       |

---

## Test Procedure

1. Place test item in radiation chamber with dosimeters.  
2. Initiate radiation exposure as per conditions above.  
3. Continuously monitor sensor functionality if possible.  
4. After exposure, allow test item to stabilize before functional testing.  
5. Perform full functional test and visual inspection.  
6. Document any radiation-induced failures, degradation, or anomalies.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- No permanent functional failures or performance degradation exceeding 5%.  
- No physical damage or discoloration indicative of radiation damage.  
- Sensor output remains stable within calibration limits.

---

## Reporting

Record dose measurements, monitoring data, and test results in the Test Results Log.
