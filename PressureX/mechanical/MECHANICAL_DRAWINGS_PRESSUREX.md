# PressureX Sensor Mechanical Drawing (Text Placeholder)

> **Status:** Placeholder document. A real vector/PDF drawing is **not** included in this repository.
> 
> This file captures the **intended interface notes** in plain text so reviewers can understand the mechanical assumptions. If you generate a real drawing export later, replace this file with the actual PDF and update the repo accordingly.

## 1. Overview
This document defines the **conceptual dimensions, tolerances, and mounting features** for the PressureX sensor housing and PCB assembly.

## 2. Sensor Housing Dimensions (mm)
- Overall length: 80.0 ± 0.2  
- Overall width: 40.0 ± 0.2  
- Overall height: 25.0 ± 0.2  

## 3. Mounting Holes
- Four mounting holes, diameter 3.2 ± 0.05 mm  
- Hole positions (center-to-center):  
  - Longitudinal spacing: 70.0 ± 0.1 mm  
  - Lateral spacing: 30.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Countersink depth: 1.5 mm for flat-head screws

## 4. PCB Dimensions
- Length: 75.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Width: 35.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Thickness: 1.6 ± 0.1 mm  

## 5. Connectors
- Connector cutout dimensions: 12.0 x 8.0 ± 0.05 mm  
- Location: 5.0 mm from rear edge, centered laterally

## 6. Materials (examples)
- Housing material: Aluminum 6061-T6  
- Surface finish: Anodized (matte)  
- PCB material: Standard FR4

## 7. Tolerances
- Linear dimensions unless otherwise specified: ± 0.1 mm  
- Angular tolerances: ± 0.5°

## 8. Notes
- All dimensions are in millimeters.
- Edges to be deburred.
- If environmental sealing is required, define gasket/O-ring material and groove geometry per the target environment.
