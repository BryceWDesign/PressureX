# Pressure Sensor Housing (IGES Placeholder)

> **Status:** Placeholder notes. A real IGES export is **not** currently included.

IGES is typically ASCII but represents geometry in a structured format; this repository currently stores interface assumptions in text only.

## Concept specs (same as STEP placeholder)
- Dimensions: 50 mm x 40 mm x 20 mm
- Material: aluminum alloy (e.g., 6061-T6) selected per environment/requirements
- Wall thickness: 3 mm
- Mounting: 4x M3 threaded holes, 35 mm spacing
- Sensor cavity + cable gland defined per use-case

## To create a real CAD export
Model the geometry in CAD and export:
- `pressure_sensor_housing.iges`

Then remove/replace this placeholder.
