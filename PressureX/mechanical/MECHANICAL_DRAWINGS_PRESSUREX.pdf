1. Overview:

This mechanical drawing defines the dimensions, tolerances, and mounting features for the PressureX sensor housing and PCB assembly.

---

2. Sensor Housing Dimensions (all in mm):

- Overall length: 80.0 ± 0.2  
- Overall width: 40.0 ± 0.2  
- Overall height: 25.0 ± 0.2  

---

3. Mounting Holes:

- Four mounting holes, diameter 3.2 ± 0.05 mm  
- Hole positions (center to center):  
  - Longitudinal spacing: 70.0 ± 0.1 mm  
  - Lateral spacing: 30.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Countersink depth: 1.5 mm for flat-head screws

---

4. PCB Dimensions:

- Length: 75.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Width: 35.0 ± 0.1 mm  
- Thickness: 1.6 ± 0.1 mm  

---

5. Connectors:

- Connector cutout dimensions: 12.0 x 8.0 ± 0.05 mm  
- Location: 5.0 mm from rear edge centered laterally  

---

6. Material Specifications:

- Housing Material: Aluminum 6061-T6  
- Surface Finish: Anodized, matte black  
- PCB Material: Standard FR4  

---

7. Tolerances:

- Linear dimensions unless otherwise specified: ± 0.1 mm  
- Angular tolerances: ± 0.5°  

---

8. Notes:

- All dimensions are in millimeters.  
- Edges to be deburred and smooth to avoid sharp edges.  
- Housing to be sealed with O-ring gasket to ensure environmental protection.  
- Assembly to allow easy access to connectors for astronaut use.
