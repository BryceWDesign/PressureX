# PressureX Sensor Mechanical Drawing (Text Placeholder)

> **Status:** Placeholder document. A real PDF drawing is **not** included in this repository.
> 
> This file records the intended geometry/callouts in plain text for review. If you later create an actual drawing export, replace this file with the real PDF and update the repo.

**Pages:** 1 (concept)  
**Units:** mm
