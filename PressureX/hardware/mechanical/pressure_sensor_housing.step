PressureX Sensor Housing (placeholder notes)

File Format: STEP (intended) — NOTE: this file is currently a text placeholder, not an exported CAD model.

Description:
- Compact shell enclosure concept for sensor + PCB
- Suggested material: high-temperature engineering plastic (select per environment and requirements)
- Pressure vent hole allows for external pressure communication (if required by use-case)

Dimensions:
- External: 35mm (L) x 25mm (W) x 15mm (H)
- Wall thickness: 2mm
- Internal cavity: Fits 30mm x 20mm PCB
- Mounting tabs: 2x M2.5 screw holes on 30mm spacing

Features:
- 1 pressure port (Ø2.5mm, center-top)
- Lid concept with screw holes for retention
- Cable exit cutout: 5mm x 3mm

Usage Notes:
- Select materials and sealing approach based on the intended environment (temperature, contamination, outgassing, serviceability).
- Verify tolerances and connector clearances in CAD prior to fabrication.

To Rebuild (in CAD):
1. Create box: 35mm x 25mm x 15mm
2. Shell: leave 2mm wall thickness
3. Add top pressure port (Ø2.5mm)
4. Add mounting tabs on bottom face
5. Cut internal pocket: 30mm x 20mm x 10mm
6. Export as `.step`
