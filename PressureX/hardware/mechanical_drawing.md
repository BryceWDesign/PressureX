# Mechanical Drawing for PressureX Sensor Housing

## Overview

This document provides critical dimensions and tolerances for the sensor housing and mounting points.

## Dimensions (in mm)

| Feature               | Dimension | Tolerance  | Notes                         |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Housing length        | 50.0      | ±0.1       | Overall length of sensor body |
| Housing width         | 35.0      | ±0.1       | Overall width                 |
| Housing height        | 20.0      | ±0.1       | Overall height                |
| Mounting hole diameter| 4.0       | ±0.05      | For M4 screws                 |
| Mounting hole spacing | 40.0      | ±0.1       | Center-to-center             |

## Material

- Aluminum alloy 6061-T6, anodized finish for corrosion resistance

## Notes

- All dimensions are in millimeters.
- Tolerances apply unless otherwise noted.
- Ensure mounting screws do not protrude inside sensor housing.
