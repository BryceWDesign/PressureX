# Fabrication Notes for PressureX PCB

## Overview

This document provides essential information for fabricating the PressureX sensor PCB.

## PCB Stackup

- 4-layer FR4 material
- Thickness: 1.6 mm
- Copper thickness: 1 oz

## Drill Specifications

- Via sizes and hole tolerances
- Plated through holes for signal and power layers

## Solder Mask and Silkscreen

- Green solder mask
- White silkscreen for component designators and orientation marks

## Assembly Notes

- Surface mount technology (SMT) components used
- Recommended soldering profile: lead-free reflow per JEDEC standards

## Testing and Inspection

- Electrical continuity and isolation tests mandatory
- Visual inspection for solder joint quality

## Additional Considerations
