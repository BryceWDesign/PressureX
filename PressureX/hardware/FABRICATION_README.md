## Assembly Instructions

- Components mounted on the top side only  
- Use lead-free solder (RoHS compliant)  
- Recommended solder paste: SAC305  
- Reflow profile: Follow standard SAC305 profile, peak temperature ~245°C

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Electrical test: Continuity and isolation testing of all nets  
- Visual inspection: Check for solder bridges, misaligned components, and defects  
- Functional test: Verify sensor readings against known pressure values

---

## Handling and Storage

- Store boards in anti-static packaging  
- Avoid exposure to moisture and contaminants  
- Follow ESD precautions during handling and assembly
