## Purpose  
Define procedures for assessing the PressureX sensor module’s resistance to ionizing radiation typically encountered in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond.

---

## Scope  
Covers Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE) testing for the PressureX sensor PCB and components.

## Test Setup  

### Equipment Required  
- Gamma radiation source (e.g., Cobalt-60)  
- Heavy ion accelerator or proton beam facility for SEE testing  
- Dosimeters and radiation sensors for dose measurement  
- Test fixture for PressureX module with power and data interfaces  

### Test Environment  
- Room temperature (23°C ± 5°C)  
- Controlled humidity (<50%)

## Test Procedures  

### Total Ionizing Dose (TID) Testing  
1. Expose the fully assembled PressureX module to incremental gamma radiation doses up to 30 krad(Si).  
2. Power the device during exposure; operate sensor to collect baseline and during-radiation data.  
3. After each dose increment, verify sensor accuracy and device functionality.  
4. Continue until maximum dose or failure threshold is reached.  

### Single Event Effects (SEE) Testing  
1. Irradiate device using heavy ions or proton beams at specified Linear Energy Transfer (LET) levels.  
2. Monitor device for single event upsets (SEU), latch-ups (SEL), or functional interrupts.  
3. Record any errors and device recovery behavior.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria  
- Device must operate within ±1% sensor accuracy post-TID exposure.  
- No permanent latch-ups or destructive failures during SEE testing.  
- Device recovery or reset must be successful after transient events.  

---

## Reporting  
Include:  
- Radiation source and parameters used  
- Dose rates and cumulative doses  
- Detailed device response logs and error counts  
- Pass/fail determinations  

---

## Remarks  
Coordinate with radiation test facilities and radiation hardening experts to validate protocols and results.
