## Purpose  
To define the procedures and acceptance criteria for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) testing of the PressureX sensor module, ensuring compliance with aerospace environment requirements.

---

## Scope  
Applies to the PressureX sensor PCB and enclosure assembly. Tests simulate electromagnetic disturbances and electrostatic events to verify device robustness and data integrity.

## Test Setup  

### Equipment Required  
- EMI test chamber (shielded)  
- Signal generator and spectrum analyzer  
- ESD simulator (compliant with IEC 61000-4-2)  
- Test fixture replicating final assembly with connectors and cabling  

### Test Environment  
- Temperature: 23°C ± 5°C  
- Relative Humidity: 45% ± 10%

## Test Procedures

### EMI Testing  
1. Place PressureX assembly inside EMI shielded chamber.  
2. Power the device and run baseline sensor data capture.  
3. Sweep frequency range 10 kHz to 18 GHz using signal generator.  
4. Monitor sensor output for any deviations or dropouts.  
5. Record any anomalies exceeding baseline noise floor by 3 dB.  

### ESD Testing  
1. Discharge ESD pulses at contact points and exposed metal surfaces per IEC 61000-4-2.  
2. Apply positive and negative discharges at 2 kV, 4 kV, 8 kV levels.  
3. Verify sensor functionality and data integrity after each discharge.  
4. Repeat tests with device powered on and off.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria  
- Sensor data must remain within ±1% accuracy tolerance during EMI exposure.  
- No functional resets or data loss allowed after ESD events.  
- No physical damage or permanent functional degradation.  

---

## Reporting  
Document all test results with:  
- Test conditions and environment parameters  
- Pass/fail status for each test level  
- Any observed anomalies or failures  

---

## Remarks  
All testing should be conducted under the supervision of a qualified EMC engineer. Use proper grounding and handling procedures to avoid damage.
