> **TEMPLATE ONLY — NO TESTING IMPLIED**

> This file is a *blank results log template*. It does **not** indicate that any thermal cycling testing has been performed.
> Populate only with traceable, reproducible information (chamber profile, dwell times, raw logs, and operator notes).

## Document Control
- Document: Thermal Cycling Test Results Log (Template)
- Revision: 1.0
- Date created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Maintainer: Bryce Lovell (BryceWDesign)
- Unit Under Test (UUT) ID / Serial: TBD
- Build revision / BOM revision: TBD

---

## 1) Test Overview
- Test objective (what question are we answering?): TBD
- Chamber type: □ Thermal chamber  □ TVAC (if applicable)  □ Other: TBD
- Intended environment (program-defined): TBD
- Protocol reference (if used): `PressureX/tests/thermal_cycling_test_protocol.md` (or applicable doc)

---

## 2) Facility / Equipment (populate only if test is executed)
- Facility name: TBD
- Chamber model/version: TBD
- Temperature sensors/RTDs (model/cal date): TBD
- Data logger/DAQ + sample rate: TBD
- Power conditions during test: □ Powered  □ Unpowered (define): TBD
- Mounting/fixturing notes: TBD

---

## 3) Thermal Profile Definition
Populate with the *actual* profile.

- Low setpoint: TBD °C
- High setpoint: TBD °C
- Ramp rate: TBD °C/min
- Dwell time at low: TBD
- Dwell time at high: TBD
- Number of cycles: TBD
- Soak/stabilization criteria (how defined): TBD

---

## 4) Pre-test Checks
- Visual inspection: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Continuity check: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Functional baseline captured: □ Yes  □ No
- Baseline file path/link: TBD

---

## 5) During-test Observations
- Resets observed: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Data dropout: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Condensation/icing observed: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Physical anomalies (warping, cracks, leakage): □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Operator notes (cycle # + timestamps): TBD

---

## 6) Post-test Checks
- Visual inspection: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Continuity check: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Functional retest: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Drift vs baseline (summary): TBD

---

## 7) Raw Data & Artifacts (REQUIRED for any “results” claim)
- Chamber log export: TBD
- Temperature sensor logs: TBD
- Sensor output logs (if powered): TBD
- Photos (setup + post-test): TBD
- Metadata (date/time, operator, ambient conditions): TBD

---

## 8) Outcome (only if pass/fail criteria defined)
> **Do not write “passed” unless criteria are explicitly defined and traceable data is attached.**
- Pass/Fail criteria reference: TBD
- Result: □ Pass  □ Fail  □ Inconclusive
- Justification (cite raw data links): TBD

---

## 9) Sign-off (only when executed)
- Operator: TBD
- Reviewer: TBD
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
