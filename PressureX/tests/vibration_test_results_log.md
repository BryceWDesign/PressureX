## 1) Test Overview
- Test objective (what question are we answering?): TBD
- Test type: □ Sine sweep  □ Random vibration  □ Combined  □ Other: TBD
- Axes tested: □ X  □ Y  □ Z
- Intended environment (program-defined): TBD
- Protocol reference (if used): `PressureX/tests/vibration_test_protocol.md`

---

## 2) Facility / Equipment (populate only if test is executed)
- Facility name: TBD
- Shaker system: TBD
- Controller model/version: TBD
- DAQ system + sample rate: TBD
- Accelerometers (model/range/cal date): TBD
- Power supply (model/settings): TBD
- Cable routing + strain relief notes: TBD

---

## 3) Mounting / Fixture Details
- Mounting interface description: TBD
- Fasteners + torque values: TBD
- Fixture drawing/photo links: TBD
- UUT orientation notes: TBD

---

## 4) Test Profile Definition
Populate with the *actual* commanded profiles.

### 4.1 Sine sweep (if applicable)
- Frequency range: TBD
- Sweep rate: TBD
- Amplitude: TBD
- Dwell points: TBD

### 4.2 Random vibration (if applicable)
- Frequency range: TBD
- Overall level (Grms): TBD
- PSD table: TBD (attach or link)
- Duration per axis: TBD

---

## 5) Pre-test Checks
- Visual inspection: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Continuity check: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Functional baseline captured: □ Yes  □ No
- Baseline file path/link: TBD

---

## 6) During-test Observations
Record any anomalies.
- Resets observed: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Data dropout: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Connector intermittence: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Unexpected noise/spikes: □ Yes  □ No (details: TBD)
- Operator notes (timestamps): TBD

---

## 7) Post-test Checks
- Visual inspection: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Continuity check: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Functional retest: □ Pass  □ Fail (notes: TBD)
- Comparison to baseline (summary): TBD

---

## 8) Raw Data & Artifacts (REQUIRED for any “results” claim)
Provide direct links or paths.
- Accelerometer raw files: TBD
- Sensor output logs: TBD
- Controller screenshots/exports: TBD
- Photos (setup + post-test): TBD
- Metadata (date/time, operator, ambient conditions): TBD

---

## 9) Outcome (only if pass/fail criteria defined)
> **Do not write “passed” unless the criteria are explicitly defined and traceable data is attached.**
- Pass/Fail criteria reference: TBD
- Result: □ Pass  □ Fail  □ Inconclusive
- Justification (cite raw data links): TBD

---

## 10) Sign-off (only when executed)
- Operator: TBD
- Reviewer: TBD
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
