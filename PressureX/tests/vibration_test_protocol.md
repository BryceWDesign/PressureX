# Vibration Test Protocol for PressureX Sensor Assembly

## Objective

To verify structural integrity and functional performance of the PressureX sensor assembly under expected vibration profiles during launch and operation.

## Test Setup

- Mount sensor assembly on standard shaker table fixture.
- Connect power and data cables as per operational setup.
- Use accelerometers at critical points for monitoring.

## Test Profile

| Frequency Range (Hz) | Acceleration (g) | Duration       | Notes               |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 20 - 2000            | 14.1 (random)    | 2 minutes per axis (X, Y, Z) | Random vibration simulating launch environment |

## Acceptance Criteria

- No mechanical damage or loosening of components.
- Sensor data remains within specified calibration limits.
- No signal dropouts or noise increase.

## Reporting

- Document pre- and post-test visual inspections.
- Record sensor output logs during testing.
- Submit test summary report with pass/fail results.
