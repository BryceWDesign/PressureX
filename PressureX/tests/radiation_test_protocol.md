# Radiation Test Protocol for PressureX Sensor Assembly

## Objective
Prototype-level radiation test planning notes to evaluate sensor assembly response to ionizing environments (if in scope).

This document is a **template** and does not claim compliance with any particular standard.

## Test Setup (generic)
- Expose sensor assembly to a defined radiation source (gamma/proton/etc as appropriate).
- Define powered vs unpowered conditions.
- Monitor sensor output and system health during exposure.
- Use dosimetry appropriate to the facility and program.

## Example Planning Table
| Radiation Type | Dose Target | Exposure Duration | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|------|
| Gamma          | Define      | Derived           | TID planning |
| Proton         | Define      | Derived           | SEE/TID depending on regime |

## Proposed Acceptance Criteria (Prototype)
- No permanent functional failure during exposure.
- Drift remains within defined tolerance relative to baseline.
- Device passes post-exposure functional checks.

## Reporting
- Document exposure parameters and dosimetry.
- Record raw sensor logs and health telemetry.
- Preserve setup details sufficient for repeatability.
