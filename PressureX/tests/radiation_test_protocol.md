# PressureX Radiation Test Protocol

## Objective

To evaluate the sensor assemblyâ€™s ability to withstand radiation exposure levels typical in low Earth orbit and deep space missions.

## Test Setup

- Radiation source: Gamma-ray and proton irradiation facilities  
- Sensor mounted in test fixture with shielding representative of spacecraft conditions  
- Instrumentation: Real-time sensor data logging and monitoring

## Radiation Exposure Levels

| Radiation Type | Total Dose (krad) | Dose Rate (krad/hr) | Duration (hours) |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Gamma Rays     | 10                | 2                   | 5                |
| Proton Beams   | 5                 | 1                   | 5                |

## Pass/Fail Criteria

- No significant degradation in sensor output signals during or after exposure  
- No permanent damage to PCB or housing components  
- Electrical continuity maintained throughout test

## Procedure

1. Secure sensor assembly in radiation test fixture.  
2. Calibrate instrumentation and start data acquisition.  
3. Expose sensor to gamma rays per dose and duration specified.  
4. Monitor and record sensor response continuously.  
5. Repeat exposure for proton beams.  
6. Post-test inspection for physical and electrical integrity.  
7. Document results comprehensively.

## Safety and Precautions

- Follow facility safety protocols strictly.  
- Ensure proper shielding and monitoring for personnel.  
- Handle radiation sources with trained personnel only.
