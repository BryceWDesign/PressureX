# Radiation Test Protocol for PressureX Sensor Assembly

## Objective

To evaluate the sensor assemblyâ€™s tolerance to ionizing radiation typical of low Earth orbit or beyond.

## Test Setup

- Expose sensor assembly to gamma and proton radiation sources.
- Power on device and monitor sensor output during exposure.
- Use dosimeters to measure total radiation dose received.

## Radiation Levels

| Radiation Type | Dose (krad) | Exposure Duration | Notes                           |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Gamma          | 30          | 24 hours          | Simulate accumulated space dose|
| Proton         | 10          | 12 hours          | Simulate solar particle events |

## Acceptance Criteria

- No permanent degradation of sensor performance.
- No data corruption or functional failure.
- Device passes post-exposure functional tests.

## Reporting

- Document exposure parameters.
- Record sensor data logs.
- Submit comprehensive test report.
