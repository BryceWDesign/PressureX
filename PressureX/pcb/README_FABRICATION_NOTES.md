# PCB Fabrication Notes for PressureX Sensor

## Overview

This document provides essential guidelines and notes for the fabrication and assembly of the PressureX sensor PCB.

---

## PCB Stackup

- 4-layer FR4 PCB  
- Thickness: 1.6 mm nominal  
- Copper weight: 1 oz per layer

---

## Materials

- Substrate: FR4  
- Soldermask: Matte black  
- Silkscreen: White, top and bottom layers

---

## Components

- All components must be RoHS compliant.  
- Use lead-free solder (SAC305 recommended).

---

## Fabrication Tolerances

- Track width tolerance: ±0.05 mm  
- Via diameter tolerance: ±0.1 mm  
- Hole size tolerance: ±0.1 mm

---

## Assembly Notes

- SMT components to be placed using standard pick-and-place methods.  
- Critical components (sensor IC, connectors) require manual inspection after placement.  
- Ensure correct orientation for polarized components.  
- Perform AOI (Automated Optical Inspection) post-solder.

---

## Testing

- Electrical test (flying probe or bed-of-nails) to verify continuity and shorts.  
- Functional testing recommended after assembly.

---

## Additional Notes

- Provide fabrication house with Gerber files, drill files, and pick-and-place data.  
- Include mechanical drawing to aid mounting hole and connector placement verification.
