# Build and Setup Instructions for PressureX

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher installed. Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- `pip` package manager (comes with Python)
- Optional but recommended: virtual environment tool (`venv` or `virtualenv`)

## Environment Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project root directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate

5. Install project dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project
1. Navigate to the src/ directory: cd src

2. Run the main script (replace main.py with your actual entry point): python main.py

Input and Output
Input data files should be placed in the appropriate input folder (e.g., inputs/), if applicable.

Output files generated by the program will be found in the outputs/ directory.

For sample input/output, see the outputs/ directory for examples.

Interpreting Results
The program outputs data files in CSV or JSON formats (specify actual format).

Use tools like Excel, or Python scripts, to analyze the output data.

Refer to the documentation in the docs/ folder for detailed analysis guides.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter import errors, verify your virtual environment is activated.

Ensure all dependencies are installed via pip install -r requirements.txt.

For additional help, check the docs/Troubleshooting.md or open an issue on GitHub.
